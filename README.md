## About Dataset
Marketing campaign data of 2,240 customers of Maven Marketing, including customer profiles, product preferences, campaign successes/failures, and channel performance. Dataset was provided by Maven Analytics in 2021. The data contained details such as: customer’s ID, date of birth, year, campaigns performed, goods purchased, customer’s age etc.
### Procedures
- Data cleaning: professionally, when working with dataset, a duplicate of the data is important. There were no null values in the data set, as well as duplicate values. Most of the column 
  names were abbreviated in the raw dataset, for ease of work I had to rename them. For more insight generation.
- Data processing/manipulation: Looking at the various variables provided in the table, I proceeded to making connections and creating insights. Columns like Age Ratings were included to 
  enable easy analysis. Pivot table was used to extract data for analysis, and create charts.
- Data modeling: Building one-to-many relationships between data tables.
- Data visualization: developed an interactive dashboard of revenue, customers complains and preferences by using various visuals such as trends, charts, slicers etc.
 ### Analysis/Findings
 - Revenue Generated per Product
   Wines generated the highest revenue which equals $680,816, followed by meat products with a revenue of $373,968. Fruits generated the least revenue of $58,917, which shows the 
   population is made up of less vegans. 
 - Purchase made per country
   It is deduced that Spain has the highest response to the campaign and has the highest wine purchase amongst the 8 countries $337,991, gold product equals $46,262, sweet product 
   $30,214, 
   fish product $40,265, meat product $179,042, fruits product $28,446. Mexico has the least response from the campaign.
 - Age rating and their preffered means of purchase
   On the dataset, I grouped the ages to the following ratings:
   18-34 years old (Adult)
   35-49 years old (Middle Age)
   50-69 years old (Elderly)
   70 and above (Aged)
   it is deduced that people in the middle age group made more purchases from the three means of purchase; web purchases: 4129, catalog purchases: 2398, store 
   purchases: 5711, followed by the elderly group. The aged people has the least participant in all means of purchase given that web purchases: 100, catalog purchases: 91, store 
   purchases: 137.
 - Web Visit Per Age Rating
   According to the data set, the company’s website showed that the highest number of visit were from the middle age group with 46% and  the least from the aged with 1%.
 - Lead Generated Per campaign in each Country
   From the above analysis, it is shown that the best response to the campaign was recorded in the sixth campaign generating 334 leads in total. Spain is seen as the country with highest 
   response to the campaign from the beginning, it records a total of 442 leads.

   ### Conclusion
   In conclusion, the outcome of the analysis showed that the response of the campaign was recorded mostly in Spain. The major product of interest is wine.
   In future, to generate more revenue, the campaign should be focused on people of the middle age group in Spain and more variety of wine should be made available. To also increase the 
   revenue, generate a customer survey for customers in the adult and elderly group. This will enable the customer to state their product preference and what excites them.
